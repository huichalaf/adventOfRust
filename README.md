# Advent of Code - Rust

## About
Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in Rust! Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. This repository contains my solutions for each day's challenge.

## Structure
Each day's challenge is placed in a separate directory, following the naming convention `day_01`, `day_02`, and so on. Inside each directory, you will find the Rust solution along with any input files and a README specific to that day's problem.

## How to Use
To run the solutions, ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once Rust is installed, navigate to the day's directory and use the command:

```
cargo run
```

This will compile and run the Rust program for that day's challenge.

## Contribution
While these solutions are primarily for my personal learning and exploration in Rust, feel free to contribute or use the code as you see fit. If you have improvements or alternative solutions, open a pull request or an issue.
